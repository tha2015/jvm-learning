- [ ] Build a custom ClassLoader for encrypted classes
- [ ] Explore OpenJDK source: `src/hotspot/share/classfile/`
- [ ] Debug class loading with `jdb` and breakpoints
- [ ] Study JVM startup process and bootstrap class loading

### Week 4-5: Memory & Garbage Collection
- [ ] Learn heap layout and GC algorithms (G1, ZGC, Shenandoah)
- [ ] Read *Java Performance* Chapters 5-6
- [ ] Complete [Java Memory Management](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-application-performance-and-memory-management/) by Matt Greencroft
- [ ] Use Eclipse MAT, VisualVM, and GCeasy for heap analysis
- [ ] Analyze a memory leak and compare GC performance using tools

---

## Phase 2: Performance & Execution (Weeks 6-9)

### Week 6-7: JIT Compilation & Benchmarking
- [ ] Study C1/C2 compilers and optimization techniques
- [ ] Read *Optimizing Java* Chapters 3-4
- [ ] Use JMH and JITWatch to create and analyze benchmarks
- [ ] Analyze JIT compilation logs with JVM flags like `-XX:+PrintCompilation`

### Week 8-9: Advanced Profiling & Native Memory
- [ ] Learn off-heap memory and native memory tracking
- [ ] Practice profiling with async-profiler and Java Flight Recorder (JFR)
- [ ] Profile a real application and optimize hotspot methods

---

## Phase 3: Modern JVM Features (Weeks 10-14)

### Week 10-12: Virtual Threads & Structured Concurrency
- [ ] Study Project Loom: virtual threads and structured concurrency APIs
- [ ] Read JEP 444 and JEP 453 specifications
- [ ] Take Rock the JVM advanced Java modules
- [ ] Build hands-on projects with virtual threads (web server, data processing)
- [ ] Migrate thread-pool based app to virtual threads and measure performance
- [ ] Study carrier thread pool behavior and pinning scenarios

### Week 13-14: Production JVM & Container Tuning
- [ ] Learn container-aware JVM tuning and monitoring
- [ ] Use JMC, Arthas, Prometheus, Grafana for observability
- [ ] Setup JFR to Prometheus to Grafana monitoring pipeline
- [ ] Apply container JVM flags and tune for production
- [ ] Hands-on container deployment and resource optimization

---

## Phase 4: Mastery & Capstone (Weeks 15-19)

### Week 15-16: GraalVM Native Image & AOT
- [ ] Learn GraalVM native image creation and limitations
- [ ] Review GraalVM documentation on native image metadata
- [ ] Build a native image for a Spring Boot app with <100ms startup

### Week 17-18: Capstone Project (choose one)
- [ ] Optimize an open-source Java app end-to-end using JVM profiling and tuning (target: 30% latency reduction)
- [ ] Build a custom JVM monitoring platform with alerting (define SLA targets)
- [ ] Migrate an existing app to virtual threads and benchmark improvements (measure throughput & resource usage)
- [ ] Deploy a production-ready GraalVM native image application (target: <100ms startup, optimized memory footprint)

### Week 19: Buffer & Review
- [ ] Complete any unfinished items from previous phases
- [ ] Review and consolidate learnings
- [ ] Plan continued learning and specialization areas
